**A fast-paced reflex game where your goal is simple:**  
🟢 Move between the top and bottom bars to score points – and dodge everything in your way.

## 🎮 Gameplay Overview

You control a ball that automatically moves up or down. Your job is to:
- Switch directions by pressing `Space` or clicking.
- Touch the **active bar** (blue) to score points.
